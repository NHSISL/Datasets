## Overview

Represents a 'golden-record' of a person. A person can be represented by multiple-patient resources across different care providers (or multiple care episodes at the same care provider).

The Person object combines national Person Demograhpics Services (PDS) sourced person records with source system "stub" fallback records (using the source systems patient record) where no PDS matched response exists.

PDS responses will always be used over an source system stub where both exist for the same person ID.
