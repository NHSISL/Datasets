üëã Hello and welcome!

This repository is a shared space for documentation of the OneLondon Data Products delivered through the *Data Engine*. The content in this repository can be provided by both the OneLondon supplier team and consumers and users of the data.

## üéØ Mission

This repository seeks to bring users together to understand the content of the datasets supplied by OneLondon to maximise their potential, and work together to plan out roadmaps for enhancing the data products further.

This repository seeks to document the various datsets used by or delivered by the One London Data Services. This includes Commissioning Data Sets, Locally Acquired and Governed Datasets and Reference data used to interrogate the data.
